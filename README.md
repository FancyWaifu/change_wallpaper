# change_wallpaper
For some computers, the admins of the computer will block you from changing the wallpaper. So I created a program to bypass it

This program works by modifing the Cached wallpaper in the file directory "C:\Users\*name here*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\CachedFiles"

You have to reboot the computer for it to take effect

Steps to running the program
1) Download the .exe file
