# change_wallpaper
The admins at our school, for some reason, blocked changing the default wallpaper. So I decieded that I wanted to make a program that'll automate the "bypass" process

This program works by modifing the Cached wallpaper in the file directory "C:\Users\*name here*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\CachedFiles"

You don't have to reboot but I recommend you do

Steps to running the program
1) Download the .exe file by clicking code then download zip
2) Once zip file is downloaded, extract it to where ever you want
3) Double click
4) Enjoy!
